notes

// one website for admin and user
	- login with phone number
	- send verification code
	- check if user is admin
	- admin page will have option to post

	- right now lookup.js line 76 sets lastMessageAt: Date() I don't think that gives the current date? Date.now? also, we should be looking for the message status and if it actually sent

	- username suggestions?

	- when do we switch users to hiatus and retired? --> add a button on dashboard 
	- what constitutes being active or on hiatus?

	-user needs current mission, current challenge
	-userChallenge needs a status completed, date started, date finished

	Adding mission/challenges:

	1. reorder challenges by dragging
	2. view/edit toggle
	3. have a trash can icon for delete (with confirmation to double check)
	4. little pop up that says "mission deleted", "mission saved", etc
	5. hooks that will update associated models (ie, adding challenge will update column in mission)
	6. adding or removing challenge will update other challenges order
	7. long/lat should pull form place
	8. is it better to set missions to state and just concat or better to dispatch again
	9. form validations for required fields and formatting
	10. cancel form if change mind

	9. mission delete should also delete challenges?
	10. send text message to users who were doing that challenge
	11. pass ideal image in to get targetTags for input form
	12. drop down so you can add unassigned challenges to a mission
	13. view and edit challenges specfically on a challenge page
